# Minesweeper

This is an attempt to build the game minesweeper in React using strict TDD. Tests are written using Jest and React Testing Library. The project was created using create-mf-app.

TODO:

- styling!
- right-click to add flag to a bomb cell

- selectors for size of the gameboard
- add a Minesweeper.tsx for the gameboard and associated controls
